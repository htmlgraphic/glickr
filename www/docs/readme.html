<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Let others view your flickr photos in your own website.</li>
	<li>View your photos organized in flickr collections or photosets as in flickr.</li>
	<li>Cache of collections and photosets for faster performance.</li>
	<li>Use of ajax when javascript is enabled in users browser.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Apache server on linux.</li>
	<li>mod_rewrite.</li>
	<li>php5.</li>
	<li>flickr username and api key.</li>
	<li>Some photos in your flickr account.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need permissions to make a directory writable, application settings and cache files will be stored in this directory.
</p>
<p>
	If you have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> account you can get your api key at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html">http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html</a>.
	<br />
	Some tools like <a href="http://idgettr.com/">idgettr.com</a> can also help you figure your user id.
</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the gallery file and upload it to your web server</li>
	<li>Point your browser to your web server and insert the required data (user id, api key)</li>
	<li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
<p>
	Note that the first time you run Glickr it will connect to flickr to build the cache files. It can take a few seconds depending on how many collections and sets you have in flickr.
</p>
<h2>Cache</h2>
<p>
	For faster performance two cache files are used to keep all the information about your photosets and collections, but no images are stored in your web server.
</p>
<p>
	If you change your photosets or collections you will need to reset the cache in order to get the changes in your gallery, you can do so visiting a special webpage http://example.com/path-to-gallery/rebuildCache in your server.
</p>
<p>
	You can visit this webpage everytime you make changes, or you can add it to your webserver scheduled tasks and make the cache be refreshed as often as you want.
</p>
<p>
	Rebuilding your cache can take some time depending on how many photosets and collections you have in flickr. It will usually take few seconds.
</p>

<h2>Use</h2>
<p>
	Glickr will first try to show your collections. If you don't have collections it will try with photosets, and finally, if no photosets are found in your flickr account it will show all your photos.
</p>
<p>
	Click on a collection title to view all photosets in the collection. Click on a photoset title to see all photos in the photoset.
</p>
<p>
	Photos are displayed as thumbnails, click on thumbnails to see a medium sized photo.
</p>
<p>
	When browsing photos in a photoset you will see links for next and previus photos in the photoset. If browsing single photos you will also have next and previous links and a back link to the photos index.
</p>

<h2>Customize</h2>
<p>
	Glickr's html is pretty simple, so most of the time you will only need to edit the included css file in css/style.css.
</p>
<p>
	In case you really need to change the html template you can do so by editing the files in the view/ folder. The file layout.php is the main layout.
</p>

<h2>Bugs?</h2>
<p>
	Yeah, sure. Just let me know if you find one and I will do my best to fix it.
